      "para-1": "Have you ever heard of BTS or BLACKPINK? Have you ever watched the series Hospital Playlist or New Journey to the West? If so, congrats! You are already involved in the K-pop world. K-pop has many forms: it can be rock, hip hop, R&B, electronic, country and definitely more. If you like this culture, you have probably surfed the internet for digging the information of the person you are interested in.",
      "para-2": "However, you might found that information can be quite scattered. For this reason, you need to browse various websites, especially cross languages. In addition, fans prefer using slang to communicate and it is unable for new fans to understand what is going on. Last but not least, music streaming platforms offer little information about artists. Therefore, users will open a new web page to search for the artist while losing focus on music, which lowers the user experience.",
      "para-3": "For the above limitations, I built this website to provide one-stop service: find the new trend of k-pop, listen to music and get the most useful information. Moreover, It is also welcome to share your cover songs to find new friends, meet your community and cheer your life!",
      "para-4": "Hope my project can levitate your mind from this f**king depressed world for a while just to enjoy music and embrace your life!"
